# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seungmiâ€”Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast

I'm a passionate and innovative data scientist with over 5 years of experience in advanced data analysis with statistics and machine learning tools. Currently pursuing a PhD in Political Science and MS in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I specialized in transforming complicated data into actionable insights and communicating these insights with both technical and non-technical audiences. 

I have a track record of successfully leading cross-functional projects that bridge the gap between engineering and social science teams, delivering data-driven solutions to solve real-world problems. My work focuses on building scalable machine learning models, optimizing algorithms, and driving innovation with dynamic/adaptive inference. 

## Areas of Expertise ðŸ§ 
* Machine Learning: Transformer Models | Recurrent Neural Networks (LSRM, GRU) | Natural Language Processing | Dynamic & Adaptive Inference | Feature Engineering
* Statistical Analysis: Time-Series Analysis | Stochastic Process | Bayesian Statistics | Causal Inference
* Programming Skills: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) | C++ | CUDA | SQL | R | Mathematica | Stata
* Project Management: Conda | Git | Slack 

## What I do ðŸ’»
I specialize in solving complicated decision-making problems using sequence models to get insights from diverse sequential data, e.g., time-series data, natural language data, user behavior data, sensor data, and financial transaction data. My expertise lies in building and optimizing Transformer models as well as RNNs, such as LSTM and GRU, for a wide range of applications. I use sequence models to forecase trends, model dependencies, and understand complex relationships within complex systems. From causal inference in time-series data to anomaly detection and sequence classification, I apply cutting-edge techniques to capture insights and drive impactful solutions at scale.

## Key Projects ðŸš€
* Causal Inference with Transformers: Developed a causal inference model using Transformers to analyze time-series trade policy data, improving policy impact analysis by 14%.
* Dynamic Clustering for International Trade: Created a dynamic clustering model by regularizing covariance matrices to improve product-level heterogeneity estimates by ~20%.
* COVID-19 Policy Modeling: Adapted agent-based models to simulate the effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, informing public health policy.

I'm always excited to explore new challenges, collaborate on open-source projects, and contribute to improvements in machine learning and data science. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
