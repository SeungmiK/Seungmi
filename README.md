# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seungmi-Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer

I am a passionate and innovative data scientist with over 5 years of experience in advanced data analysis with statistics and machine learning tools. Currently pursuing a PhD in Political Science and MS in Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my work focuses on building explainable ML frameworks, utilizing my robust theoretical knowledge in Statistics such as Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (PGMs), Causal Inference, Time-Series Analysis, and Stochastic Process. I am specialized in transforming complicated data into actionable insights and communicating these insights with both technical and non-technical audiences. I have a track record of successfully leading cross-functional projects that bridge the gap between engineering and social science teams, delivering data-driven solutions to solve real-world problems.

## Areas of Expertise ðŸ§ 
* Machine Learning: Explainable AI Frameworks (XAI) | Transformer Models | Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN; LSRM, GRU) | Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Large Language Models (LLMs) | Feature Engineering
* Statistical Analysis: Causal Inference | Probabilistic Graphical Modeling | Time-Series Analysis | Stochastic Process | Bayesian Statistics 
* Programming Skills: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn) | C++ | CUDA | SQL | R | Mathematica | Stata
* Project Management: Conda | Git | Slack 

## What I do ðŸ’»
I specialize in solving complicated decision-making problems using sequence models to get insights from diverse sequential data, e.g., time-series data, natural language data, user behavior data, sensor data, and financial transaction data. My expertise lies in building and optimizing Transformer models as well as RNNs, such as LSTM and GRU, for a wide range of applications. I use sequence models to forecast trends, model dependencies, and understand hidden relationships within complicated systems. From causal inference in time-series data to anomaly detection and sequence classification, I apply cutting-edge techniques to capture insights and drive impactful solutions at scale.

## Key Projects ðŸš€
* Causal Transformer for E-Commerce Credit Card Fraud Detection: Developed a Causal Transformer with Bayesian Network and Posterior Inference to improve fraud prediction accuracy and also understand causality underlying fraud detection.
* Network Analysis for Policy Diffusion: Performed a Social Network analysis to understand how environmental trade policies diffuse across countries using panel data on environmental non-tariff barriers. 
* Dynamic Clustering for International Trade: Created a dynamic clustering model by regularizing covariance matrices to improve product-level heterogeneity estimates.
* COVID-19 Policy Modeling: Adapted agent-based models to simulate the effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, informing public health policy.

I'm always excited to explore new challenges, collaborate on open-source projects, and contribute to improvements in machine learning and data science. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
